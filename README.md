  <p>Pre-Processing Pipeline for Emails</p>
</h3>


This repo implements a pre-processing pipeline for emails (`.eml` files). Currently, the pipeline is capable of extracting the header, body, images, and attachments from emails.

The API is hosted at `https://api.unstructured.io`.


## Developer Quick Start

* Using `pyenv` to manage virtualenv's is recommended
	* Mac install instructions. See [here](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/community#mac--homebrew) for more detailed instructions.
		* `brew install pyenv-virtualenv`
	  * `pyenv install 3.8.15`
  * Linux instructions are available [here](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/community#linux).

  * Create a virtualenv to work in and activate it, e.g. for one named `emails`:

	`pyenv  virtualenv 3.8.15 emails` <br />
	`pyenv activate emails`

* Run `make install`
* Start a local jupyter notebook server with `make run-jupyter` <br />
	**OR** <br />
	just start the fast-API locally with `make run-web-app`

#### Extracting whatever from some type of document

Give a description of making API calls using example `curl` commands, and example JSON responses.

For example:
```
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8000/emails/v0.0.2/email' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
  -F 'files=@fake-email.eml' \
  -F 'include_headers=False'  | jq -C . | less -R
```

It's also nice to show how to call the API function using pure Python.

### Generating Python files from the pipeline notebooks

You can generate the FastAPI APIs from your pipeline notebooks by running `make generate-api`.
